# Warts and verrucas

**Warts and verrucas are small lumps on the skin that most  people have at some point in their life. They usually go away on their  own but may take months or even years.**

Warts do not cause you any harm, but some people find them  itchy, painful or embarrassing. Verrucas are more likely to be painful – like standing on a needle.

You can treat warts if they bother you, keep coming back or are painful.

## A pharmacist can help with warts and verrucas

You can buy creams, plasters and sprays from pharmacies to treat warts and verrucas.

These treatments can take up to 3 months to complete, may irritate your skin  and do not always work. You should not use these treatments on your  face.

Your pharmacist can give you advice about the best treatment for you.

## Treatment from a GP

A GP may be able to freeze a wart or verruca so it falls off a few weeks later. Sometimes it takes a few sessions.

Check with the GP if the NHS pays for this treatment in your area.

If treatment has not worked or you have a wart on your face, the GP might  refer you to a skin specialist. Other treatments include minor surgery  and treatment with laser or light.

## How to stop warts and verrucas spreading

Warts and verrucas are caused by a virus. They can be spread  to other people from contaminated surfaces or through close skin  contact. You're more likely to spread a wart or verruca if your skin is  wet or damaged.

It can take months for a wart or verruca to appear after contact with the virus.
