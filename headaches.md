# Headaches

**Most headaches go away on their own and are not a sign of something more serious.**

## How you can ease headaches yourself

Headaches can last between 30 minutes and several hours.

> ### **Do**
>
> - drink plenty of water
> - get plenty of rest if you have a cold or the flu

> - do not drink alcohol
> - do not skip meals (even if you might not feel like eating anything)

> ### **See a GP if:**
>
> - your headache keeps coming back
> - painkillers do not help and your headache gets worse
