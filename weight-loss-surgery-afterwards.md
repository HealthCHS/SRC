**You can usually leave hospital 1 to 3 days after having  weight loss surgery. You'll be able to start to return to your normal  activities 4 to 6 weeks later.**

But you'll need to make long-term lifestyle changes to help make the most of your surgery.

## Diet after weight loss surgery

You'll be given a diet plan to follow after surgery.

These vary from person to person, but a typical plan is:

- first few days – water and fluids (for example, thin soup)
- first 4 weeks – runny food (for example, yoghurt or puréed food)
- weeks 4 to 6 – soft food (for example, mashed potato)
- week 6 onwards – gradually return to a healthy, [balanced diet](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/)

You will also be advised to:

- eat slowly, chew carefully and only eat small amounts at a time – particularly during the early stages of your recovery
- avoid, or be careful when eating, foods that could block your stomach, such as soft white bread
- take [vitamin and mineral](vitamins-and-minerals.md) supplements

The charity WLS Info has more information about [eating after your operation](http://www.wlsinfo.org.uk/weight-loss-surgery/post-op-and-aftercare/eating-after-your-operation/).

## Exercise after weight loss surgery

As well as eating healthily, you'll need to exercise regularly to help you lose as much weight as possible after the operation.

You may be given an exercise plan. This will usually involve increasing  your activity levels gradually as you recover from surgery.

Once  you've fully recovered, you should aim to do regular activities that are intense enough to leave you feeling out of breath and make your heart  beat faster, such as:

- brisk walking
- cycling
- gardening or housework
- swimming

Choose something you enjoy as you'll be more likely to stick with it.

## Follow-up appointments

After weight loss surgery, you'll be asked to attend regular follow-up appointments for the rest of your life.

These appointments will usually be in a weight loss surgery clinic for at  least the first 2 years, but eventually you may just need a check-up  with a GP once a year.

Follow-up appointments may involve:

- [blood tests](blood-tests.md) to check your vitamin and mineral levels
- a physical health check
- advice and support about diet and exercise
- emotional or psychological support

## Pregnancy and contraception after weight loss surgery

Women are usually advised to avoid becoming pregnant during the period of  most significant weight loss in the first 12 to 18 months after surgery.

This is because weight loss surgery can affect your vitamin and mineral  levels. If your levels are low while you're pregnant, there's a risk it  could harm your baby.

It's a good idea to:

- use  contraception until advised it's safe to become pregnant – ask your  doctor about the best type, as some are not suitable for women who've  had weight loss surgery (including the [contraceptive pill](contraception-combined-contraceptive-pill.md) and [contraceptive injection](contraception-contraceptive-injection.md))
- speak to your doctor if you become pregnant soon after surgery or you're  planning a pregnancy at any stage after surgery – they can check your  vitamin and mineral levels, and advise you about supplements (find  out about [vitamins and nutrition in pregnancy](pregnancy-and-baby-vitamins-minerals-supplements-pregnant.md))

## Help and support

Having weight loss surgery can be physically and emotionally draining.

Support will be provided as part of your follow-up, but you may also find  it useful to talk with people who have also had weight loss surgery.

Ask your specialist about any charities and support groups in your area or check the [WLS Info website](http://www.wlsinfo.org.uk/help-and-support/support-groups/).

## When to get medical advice

In the days or weeks after surgery, call your GP or [NHS 111](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care/nhs-111/) immediately if you have:

- really bad tummy pain in your tummy, or tummy pain that does not go away or is getting worse
- an unusually fast heartbeat
- a high temperature
- [chest pain](chest-pain.md) or [shortness of breath](shortness-of-breath.md)
- being sick (vomiting) or [vomiting blood](vomiting-blood.md)
- [difficulty swallowing](swallowing-problems-dysphagia.md)
- dark, sticky poo
- signs of a wound infection, such as pain, redness, swelling and pus

In the months after surgery, make an appointment to see a GP if you:

- have pain in your tummy that comes and goes
- vomit every now and again
- have [heartburn](heartburn-and-acid-reflux.md)
- keep coughing at night
- feel sick most of the time
- have [diarrhoea](diarrhoea.md) that does not go away
- have times where you feel flushed, sweaty or faint
