- [Treatment](yellow-fever-vaccination.md)

**Yellow fever is a serious infection spread by  mosquitoes. It's found in parts of Africa, South America, Central  America and Trinidad in the Caribbean.**

There's a vaccine that can stop you getting yellow fever if you're travelling to an area where the infection is found.

## Yellow fever vaccination

The yellow fever vaccine is recommended if you're travelling to:

- an area where yellow fever is found
- a country that requires you to have a certificate proving you've been vaccinated against yellow fever

You need to have the vaccine at least 10 days before travelling to give it  enough time to work. Your certificate will only be valid after this  time.

If you or your child has had the [MMR vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/mmr-vaccine/), you or they ideally need to wait at least 4 weeks before having the yellow fever vaccine.

The vaccine and certificate are only available from [registered yellow fever vaccination centres](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/search-centres).

The jab is not available for free on the NHS so you'll have to pay for it. It typically costs around £60 to £85.

The vaccine provides lifelong protection for most travellers, so you will not normally need a booster dose.

- parts of sub-Saharan Africa (the area below the Sahara desert)
- parts of South America
- parts of Central America

## How yellow fever is spread

Yellow fever is a virus spread by mosquito bites. You cannot get it from close contact with someone who has it.

The mosquitoes that spread the infection are found in towns, cities and rural areas. They mainly bite during the day.

Mosquitoes can also spread other serious illnesses, such as [malaria](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/malaria/) and [dengue](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dengue/).

If you're travelling to an area where yellow fever is found, try to avoid being bitten, even if you have been vaccinated. 

You can do this by using mosquito nets, wearing clothes that cover your  arms and legs, and using insect repellent containing 30% to 50% DEET  (diethyltoluamide).

## Symptoms of yellow fever

The first symptoms of yellow fever usually develop 3 to 6 days after being infected.

They include:

- a high temperature
- a [headache](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/headaches/)
- feeling sick or vomiting
- muscle pain and [backache](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/back-pain/)
- your eyes being sensitive to light
- loss of appetite and feeling generally unwell

Up to 1 in 4 people go on to get more serious symptoms, such as:

- yellowing of the skin and eyes [(jaundice)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice/)
- bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or ears
- [vomiting blood](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vomiting-blood/) or [blood in poo](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bleeding-from-the-bottom-rectal-bleeding/)

## When to get medical help

See a doctor straight away if you get symptoms of yellow fever while travelling in an area where the infection is found.

If you get symptoms after recently returning from one of these areas, contact a GP or [NHS 111](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care/nhs-111/) for advice as soon as possible.

Tell them exactly where you have been travelling, whether you think you have been bitten by a mosquito, and what symptoms you have.

You may need to have a [blood test](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-tests/) to check for the infection.

## Treatments for yellow fever

There's no cure for yellow fever, but the symptoms can be treated while your body fights off the infection.

Most people make a full recovery after 3 or 4 days.

However, up to half of those who have the more serious symptoms of yellow fever will die.

Painkillers such as [paracetamol](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/) or [ibuprofen](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/) can help lower your temperature and relieve aches or pains in the meantime. 

Also drink plenty of fluids to avoid [dehydration](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dehydration/).

If you have more serious symptoms, you may need to go into hospital for  close monitoring and treatment of your symptoms until you're feeling  better.
