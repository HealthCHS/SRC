- **Finding help and support**

There's a lot of information and support available for type 2 diabetes. Some of the support depends on the area you live in.



## Take a course to help you manage your diabetes

There are free education courses to help you learn more about and manage your type 2 diabetes.

Your GP will need to refer you, but you can phone your GP surgery to get a referral letter, so you do not need to make an appointment.

Read more information about [education courses for type 2 diabetes](http://www.desmond-project.org.uk/).



## Telling DVLA you have type 2 diabetes

If you're taking insulin for your type 2 diabetes, you will need to [tell DVLA](https://www.gov.uk/diabetes-driving). This is because of the risk of [low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)](low-blood-sugar-hypoglycaemia.md). You can be fined if you do not tell DVLA.



## Support groups for type 2 diabetes

The charity Diabetes UK runs [local support groups](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/How_we_help/Local_support_groups/).

These can help with things like managing your diabetes on a daily basis, diet, exercise or dealing with emotional problems, such as depression. They offer a place to talk and find out how others live with the condition.



# Blogs, forums and apps

- [Diabetes.co.uk forum](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/) – discussions about living with and managing diabetes
- [Diabetes UK blogs](http://blogs.diabetes.org.uk/) – a collection of blogs on work and diabetes, food, eyes and more
- [Diabetes Chat](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-chat/) – scheduled chats with healthcare professionals or just the chance to talk to others
- [NHS Apps Library](https://apps.beta.nhs.uk/category/diabetes/) – find apps and tools to help you manage your diabetes, including some that link you to a lifestyle coach


## Telling others can be difficult

It can be difficult to tell others you have diabetes, but it can help for certain people to know:

- family can support you – especially as you will need to make changes to what you eat
- it's important your colleagues or employer know in case of an emergency
- being diagnosed with diabetes can affect your mood – telling your partner will help them understand how you feel



## Carry medical ID in case of an emergency

Some people choose to wear a special wristband or carry something in their wallet that says they have diabetes, in case of an emergency.

If it's known that you have diabetes, this can make a difference to the treatment you'll receive.

Search the internet for "medical ID" to find websites that sell them.
