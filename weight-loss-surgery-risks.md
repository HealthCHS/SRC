**Weight loss surgery carries a risk of complications, some of which can be serious.**

Before having surgery, speak to your surgeon about the possible benefits and risks of the procedure.



## Blood clots

You'll have [treatment to reduce your risk of blood clots](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-clots/) after surgery, such as special leg stockings or blood-thinning medicine, but you can sometimes still get them.

Common places to get blood clots are in the lower leg [(deep vein thrombosis)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/) or lungs [(pulmonary embolism)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-embolism/).

Symptoms can include:

- your lower leg becoming painful, achy and tender
- swelling, redness or warmth in your lower leg
- a sharp, stabbing [chest pain](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chest-pain/) that may be worse when breathing in
- shortness of breath or a [cough](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cough/)
- feeling [faint or dizzy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dizziness/)

Contact a GP or NHS 111 as soon as possible if you think you might have a blood clot.



## Wound infection

Sometimes the wounds from your surgery can become infected while they're healing.

Signs of a wound infection can include:

- pain in or around the wound
- red, hot and swollen skin
- pus coming from the wound

Contact a GP or NHS 111 if you think your wound may be infected. They may prescribe a course of [antibiotics](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antibiotics/).



## Gastric band slipping out of place

If you have gastric band surgery, there's a small risk that the band could move out of position.

This can cause:

- [heartburn](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/)
- feeling sick
- vomiting

See a GP if you have these symptoms and they do not go away. If your band  has moved, you'll need further surgery to put it back in place or remove it.



## Leak in the gut

In the days or weeks after a gastric  bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, there's a small chance that food could  leak out into your tummy.

This can cause a serious infection inside your tummy.

Symptoms of a leak can include:

- a high temperature
- a fast heartbeat
- tummy pain
- chills and shivering
- fast breathing

Call your GP or [NHS 111](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care/nhs-111/) as soon as possible if you have these symptoms. You may need surgery to repair the leak and antibiotics to treat any infection.



## Blocked gut

Sometimes the stomach or small intestine  can become narrower or blocked after weight loss surgery. This can  happen as a result of the side effects of the surgery, such as scarring  and reduced blood flow to the area.

The blockage can cause a number of complications, including food getting stuck and your gut becoming kinked or twisted.

This can then cause the following symptoms:

- [difficulty swallowing](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/swallowing-problems-dysphagia/)
- you keep being sick (vomiting)
- tummy pain
- not needing to poo as often as usual

Contact a GP or NHS 111 as soon as possible if you have these symptoms. You may need to have a procedure to widen or clear the blockage using a thin,  flexible tube passed down your throat [(endoscope)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/endoscopy/).

Cutting food into small chunks, chewing thoroughly and not drinking during meals can help reduce the risk of a blockage.



## Malnutrition

Weight loss surgery can make it harder for your gut to absorb [vitamins and minerals](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/) from food, so there's a risk you could become malnourished.

This might not always be obvious, but possible symptoms can include:

- feeling tired or lacking energy all the time
- [shortness of breath](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/)
- noticeable heartbeats [(palpitations)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-palpitations/)
- pale skin
- [pins and needles](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pins-and-needles/)
- feeling weak

Having a [balanced diet](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/) can help reduce the risk of malnutrition, but most people need to take extra nutritional supplements for life after surgery.

You'll have regular [blood tests](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-tests/) after surgery to measure your vitamin and mineral levels, so any problems can be picked up and treated.



## Gallstones

It's common to develop [gallstones](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gallstones/) in the first year or two after weight loss surgery. These are small,  hard stones in the gallbladder that can form if you lose weight quickly.

The main [symptom of gallstones](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gallstones/symptoms/) is episodes of severe tummy pain that come on suddenly and can last a few minutes to a few hours.

They can also sometimes cause:

- a high temperature
- a fast heartbeat
- yellowing of the skin and eyes [(jaundice)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice/)
- [itchy skin](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/itchy-skin/)
- chills or shivering
- [confusion](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/confusion/)

See a GP if you have symptoms of gallstones. You may need an [operation to remove your gallbladder](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gallbladder-removal/).



## Excess skin

As you lose weight after surgery, you may be left with excess folds and rolls of skin, particularly around your  breasts, tummy, hips and limbs.

Surgery, such as a [tummy tuck](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-treatments/tummy-tuck/), can be used to remove the excess skin. But its usually considered [cosmetic surgery](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-treatments/) so it is not always available on the NHS.

Ask as GP if surgery to remove excess skin after weight loss surgery is provided on the NHS where you live.



## Risk of dying

Weight loss surgery is a major  operation and there is a chance of dying during the procedure or as a  result of a serious complication afterwards.

But this is rare.
