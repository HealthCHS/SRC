## How you can treat a cough yourself
There's usually no need to see a GP.

You should:

- rest
- drink plenty of fluids
You could also try:

- [paracetamol](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/) or [ibuprofen](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/) to treat any pain
- hot lemon and honey (not suitable for babies under 1 year old)
- a herbal medicine called pelargonium (suitable for people aged 12 or over)

But there's limited evidence to show these work.

<details>
<summary>How to make a hot lemon and honey drink</summary>
1. Squeeze half a lemon into a mug of boiled water.
2. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey.
3. Drink while still warm (do not give hot drinks to small children).
</details>

Hot lemon with honey has a similar effect to cough medicines.



## A pharmacist can help if you have a cough

If you have a cough, you can ask a pharmacist about:

- cough syrup
- cough medicine (some cough medicines should not be given to children under 12)
- cough sweets

These will not stop your cough, but may help you cough less.

Decongestants and cough medicines containing codeine will not stop your cough.

> Call a pharmacy or contact them online before going in person. You can get medicines delivered or ask someone to collect them.

:::tip See a GP if:
- you've had a cough for more than 3 weeks (persistent cough)
- your cough is very bad or quickly gets worse – for example, you have a hacking cough or cannot stop coughing
- you feel very unwell
- you have chest pain
- you're losing weight for no reason
- the side of your neck feels swollen and painful (swollen glands)
- you find it hard to breathe
- you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of chemotherapy or diabetes

**See a GP urgently if you're coughing up blood.**

## What happens at your appointment

To find out what's causing your cough, the GP might:

- take a sample of any mucus you might be coughing up
- order an X-ray, allergy test, or a test to see how well your lungs work
- refer you to hospital to see a specialist, but this is rare

:::warning Important
[Antibiotics](antibiotics.md) are not normally prescribed for coughs. A GP will only prescribe them if you need them – for example, if you have a bacterial infection or you're at risk of complications.

## What causes coughs

Most coughs are caused by a cold or flu.

Other causes include:

- smoking
- heartburn (acid reflux)
- allergies – for example, hay fever
- infections like bronchitis
- mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose

A cough is rarely a sign of something serious like lung cancer.
