Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed following blood or urine tests for something else.

However, you should see a GP straight away if you have any [symptoms of diabetes](type-2-diabetes-symptoms.md).

To find out if you have type 2 diabetes, you usually have to go through the following steps:

1. See a GP about your symptoms.
2. The GP will check your urine and arrange a blood test to check your blood sugar levels. It usually takes about 1 to 2 days for the results to come back.
3. If you have diabetes, the GP will explain the test results and what will happen next.



## If you're diagnosed with diabetes

What the GP will discuss with you during your appointment depends on the diagnosis and the treatment they recommend.

Generally, they'll talk to you about:

- what diabetes is
- what high blood sugar means for your health
- whether you need to take medicine
- your diet and exercise
- your lifestyle â€“ for example, alcohol and smoking

:::warning Important
The GP will do their best to discuss the diagnosis with you, but this first appointment might only be 10 to 15 minutes.

## If you have questions about your diagnosis

It's usually difficult to take in everything the GP tells you during the appointment.

Then make another GP appointment and take your list of questions with you.

There's also a lot of [information on diabetes](type-2-diabetes-finding-help-and-support.md) available.
