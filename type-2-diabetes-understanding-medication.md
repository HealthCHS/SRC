## Medicines for type 2 diabetes

Most people need medicine to control their type 2 diabetes.

Medicine helps keep your blood sugar level as normal as possible to prevent health problems. You may have to take it for the rest of your life.

Diabetes usually gets worse over time, so your medicine or dose may need to change.

[Adjusting your diet and being active](type-2-diabetes-food-and-keeping-active.md) is usually necessary to keep your blood sugar level down.



## Getting the right medicine for you

Diabetes medicines help lower the amount of sugar in your blood.

:::warning Important
There are many types of medicine for type 2 diabetes. It can take time to find a medicine and dose that's right for you.
:::

You'll usually be offered a medicine called [metformin](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/metformin/) first.

If your blood sugar levels are not lower after taking metformin, you may need another medicine.

Over time, you may need a combination of medicines. Your GP or diabetes nurse will recommend the medicines most suitable for you.

Insulin is not often used for type 2 diabetes in the early years. It's usually needed when other medicines no longer work.

Diabetes UK has more information about [taking medicines for type 2 diabetes](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/Guide-to-diabetes/What-is-diabetes/Diabetes-treatments/).

## Taking your medicine

Your GP or diabetes nurse will explain how to take your medicine and how to store it.

If you need to inject insulin, they'll show you how.

## Side effects

Your diabetes medicine may cause side effects.

These can include:

- bloating and diarrhoea
- weight loss or weight gain
- feeling sick
- swelling in one or more parts of your body due to a build-up of fluid under your skin

Not everyone has side effects.

If you feel unwell after taking medicine or notice any side effects, speak to your GP or diabetes nurse.

Do not stop taking medicine without getting advice.



## How to get free prescriptions for diabetes medicine
You're entitled to free prescriptions for your diabetes medicine.

To claim your free prescriptions, you'll need to apply for an exemption certificate. This is known as a PF57 form.

To do this:

- fill in a form at your GP surgery
- you should get the certificate in the post about a week later – it'll last for 5 years
- take it to your pharmacy with your prescriptions
Save your receipts if you have to pay for diabetes medicine before you receive your exemption certificate. You can claim the money back if you include the receipts along with your completed PF57 form.



## Travelling with diabetes medicines

If you're going on holiday:

- pack extra medicine – speak to your diabetes nurse about how much to take
- carry your medicine in your hand luggage just in case checked-in bags go missing or get damaged
- if you're flying with a medicine you inject, get a letter from your GP that says you need it to treat diabetes
