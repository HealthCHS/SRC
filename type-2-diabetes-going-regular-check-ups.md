Type 2 diabetes check-ups help to make sure your condition does not lead to [other health problems](type-2-diabetes-health-problems.md).



## Every 3 months

### Blood sugar checks (HbA1C test)

Checks your average blood sugar levels and how close they are to normal.

You have these checks every 3 months when newly diagnosed, then every 6 months once you're stable.

This can be done by your GP or diabetes nurse.



## Once a year

### Feet

Checks if you've lost any feeling in your feet, and for ulcers and infections.

This can be done by your GP, diabetes nurse or podiatrist.

Speak to your GP immediately if you have cuts, bruises or numbness in your feet.

### Eyes

Checks for damage to blood vessels in your eyes.

Speak to your GP immediately if you have blurred vision.

### Blood pressure, cholesterol and kidneys

Checks for high blood pressure, heart and kidney disease.

This can be done by your GP or diabetes nurse.
