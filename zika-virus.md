# Zika virus



**Zika virus disease is mainly spread by mosquitoes. For most people it's a very mild infection and is not harmful.**

But it may be more serious for pregnant women, as there's evidence it  causes birth defects – in particular, abnormally small heads  (microcephaly).

Zika does not naturally occur in the UK. Zika  outbreaks have been reported in the Pacific region, South and Central  America, the Caribbean, Africa, and parts of south and southeast Asia.

If you plan to travel to an affected area, seek travel health advice before your trip.

Travel advice is tailored to you and based on the [level of risk](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/zika-virus-country-specific-risk) (risk or very low risk) for the country you're travelling to.

Specific recommendations for pregnant women considering travel to affected  countries or areas can be found in the "other risks" section of the [NaTHNaC country information pages](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries).

If you travel to an affected area, you can reduce your risk of catching  the virus by using insect repellent and wearing loose clothing that  covers your arms and legs.



## Symptoms of Zika virus infection

Most people have minimal symptoms or no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they're usually mild and last around 2 to 7 days.

Commonly reported symptoms include:

- a rash
- itching all over the body
- a high temperature
- a headache
- joint pain (with possible swelling, mainly in the smaller joints of the hands and feet)
- muscle pain
- red eyes (conjunctivitis)
- lower back pain
- pain behind the eyes



## How you catch Zika virus infection

Most cases of Zika virus disease are spread by infected mosquitoes biting humans.

Unlike the mosquitoes that spread malaria, affected mosquitoes (the Aedes  mosquito) are most active during the day, especially during mid-morning, then late afternoon to dusk.

There have been a small number of  reports of Zika virus being passed on through sexual intercourse,  although the risk is thought to be low.



## Reducing your risk of Zika virus infection

Before travelling, seek travel health advice from a GP, practice nurse or a travel clinic, ideally 4 to 6 weeks before you go.

You can use this [A to Z guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/zika-virus-country-specific-risk#atoz) to check if the country you're visiting has a risk for Zika virus transmission.

Detailed travel health advice for your destination is also available from the [TravelHealthPro website](http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/) or the Scottish travel health service [fitfortravel](http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/home.aspx).

To reduce your risk of infection, you should avoid being bitten by an Aedes mosquito.

The most effective bite prevention methods, which should be used during daytime and night-time hours, include:

- using insect repellent that contains DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) on  exposed skin after sunscreen has been applied (DEET can be used by  pregnant or breastfeeding women in concentrations up to 50%, and in  infants and children older than 2 months, but should not be used on  babies younger than 2 months)
- wearing loose clothing that covers your arms and legs
- sleeping under a mosquito net in areas where malaria is also a risk



## Advice for pregnant women 

Scientists have concluded  that there's enough evidence to show that Zika virus infection is a  cause of birth defects, including microcephaly.

Microcephaly means the baby will have an abnormally small head and can be associated with  abnormal brain development. This is also known as congenital Zika  syndrome.

Specific recommendations for pregnant women considering  travel to affected countries or areas can be found in the "other risks"  section of the [NaTHNaC country information pages](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries).

Discuss your travel plans with a GP, practice nurse or travel clinic. If travel is unavoidable, you should take extra care to avoid being bitten by  mosquitoes.

If you and your partner are currently in an area with a risk of Zika virus transmission, make sure you use condoms during  vaginal, anal and oral sex while travelling and for the duration of your pregnancy.

If you're pregnant and have recently returned from a  country or an area with a risk of Zika virus transmission, see a GP or  midwife and mention where you have been, even if you have not been  unwell.

Your midwife or hospital doctor will discuss the risk with you and can arrange an ultrasound scan of your baby to monitor growth.

If there are any issues, you'll be referred to a specialist foetal medicine service for further monitoring.

Zika virus is most likely to be detected by currently available tests when symptoms are present.

If you're currently experiencing Zika symptoms, contact a GP, who will decide whether investigations are necessary.

Investigations might include a blood test and an ultrasound test if you're pregnant.

Screening tests for Zika are not available for those without symptoms.



## Advice for women trying to get pregnant

If you're trying to get pregnant, discuss your travel plans with a GP, practice nurse or travel clinic.

You should take extra care to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

Women should avoid becoming pregnant while travelling in a country or area with a risk for Zika virus transmission.

On returning to the UK, you should avoid becoming pregnant for a further 2 months if only the woman travelled, and for 3 months if both partners  or just the male partner travelled.

If you have experienced Zika symptoms within 2 weeks of returning home,  it's recommended that you wait 2 months after full recovery before you  try to get pregnant.

If your male partner has travelled to an area with risk for Zika virus transmission, you should use effective  contraception to prevent pregnancy.

You should also use condoms during vaginal, anal and oral sex to reduce the risk of sexual transmission.

These measures should be taken during travel and for 3 months:

- after the start of symptoms (if he does experience Zika symptoms or a Zika virus infection has been confirmed by a doctor)
- after his return home (if he has no Zika symptoms)



## How Zika virus infection is treated

There's no specific treatment for Zika virus symptoms.  Drinking plenty of water and taking paracetamol may help relieve  symptoms.

If you feel unwell after returning from a country that  has malaria, as well as having a risk of Zika virus transmission, you  should seek urgent (same day) advice to help rule out a malaria  diagnosis.

If you remain unwell and malaria has been shown not to be the cause, seek medical advice.

### What if I'm worried that my baby has been affected by Zika?

Speak to your midwife or doctor for advice.

If you're still concerned after receiving assurances from your healthcare  professional and feel more anxious or stressed than usual, you can ask a GP or midwife for referral to further counselling.



## Zika virus and blood donation

As a precaution, the [NHS Blood and Transplant service](https://www.blood.co.uk/news-and-campaigns/news-and-statements/statement-nhs-blood-and-transplant-response-to-the-zika-virus/) has recommended that people who have travelled to areas with a risk of  Zika virus transmission wait 28 days before donating blood.

If you want to know whether any recent foreign travel temporarily bars you  from giving blood, you can call their National Contact Centre on 0300  123 23 23.



## Zika virus and Guillain-Barré syndrome

Scientists now believe that Zika virus is a cause of [Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/), a serious condition of the nervous system.

The risk of developing GBS after a Zika virus infection is currently unknown, but thought to be very low.



## Information about you

If you have been infected with  the Zika virus, your clinical team will pass on information about you to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service  (NCARDRS).

This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
