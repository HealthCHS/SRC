## Check if you have type 2 diabetes

Many people have type 2 diabetes without realising. This is because symptoms do not necessarily make you feel unwell.

Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include:

- peeing more than usual, particularly at night
- feeling thirsty all the time
- feeling very tired
- losing weight without trying to
- itching around your penis or vagina, or repeatedly - getting thrush
- cuts or wounds taking longer to heal
- blurred vision

You're more at risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:

- are over 40 (or 25 for south Asian people)
- have a close relative with diabetes (such as a parent, brother or sister)
- are overweight or obese
- are of Asian, African-Caribbean or black African origin (even if you were born in the UK)

:::tip See a GP if:
- you have any of the symptoms of type 2 diabetes
- you're worried you may have a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes

[A GP can diagnose diabetes](type-2-diabetes-getting-diagnosed.md). You'll need a blood test, which you may have to go to your local health centre for if it cannot be done at your GP surgery.

The earlier diabetes is diagnosed and treatment started, the better. Early treatment reduces your risk of [other health problems](type-2-diabetes-health-problems.md).
